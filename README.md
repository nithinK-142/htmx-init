# HTMX Init

This project was created by following [Travesty Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UvA7zvwsmg) with slight modifications. It uses a Node/Express server. All of the HTMX is in the `/public` .html files.

There are several examples:

- `temperature.html`: Simple temperature converter
- `polling.html`: Example of polling (making a request every x seconds) using a mock weather api
- `search.html`: A contact search widget
- `validation.html`: Inline validation example
- `profile.html`: Simple profile click-to-edit
- `index.html`: Link to projects
